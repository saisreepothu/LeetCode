Amazon taught me so much, from designing experiments that shaped product decisions, to building anomaly detection systems at scale, to learning how to translate messy,


given business req can you design an err model or uml
tips identify entity types, relation types, cardinality, attribute types and enhancements


gven an eer model or uml model can you describe the business process
weal entity types? existence dependent entity tyoes? multi values attri? cardinalities?

4 skip 

relational model 

types of keys 
relational constraints 
domain constraints
key constraints
entity integrity constraints
referential integrity constraints

Normalization why?
informal guidelines
functional dependency imp
what is a prime attribute

Normal forms 

given a relation know the which normal form and convert to required normal form  - 4 normal form

non prime attribute type  (1, 2, 3 most )
1, 2, 3, 3.5, 4 NF's

always check the 1nf after 3 nf

which nf is the relation is and then ans 1nf and then convert 

Mapping EER model to relational model 

follow the rules and copy rules

entities, binary 1:1, 1:n, n:m, unary, n-nary, Multivalued attr, weal entity type, specialization which option to use 

given assumptions can you identity super keys, keys, candidate and alternative keys

given a relation and assumption can ou determine whicch NF the relation is at?

goven relation and assumptions can you normalize a relation that is not in 4 NF yet?

given a EER model or UML model can you map it to a relational model ?
